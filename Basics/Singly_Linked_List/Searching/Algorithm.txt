Searching for a Node in a Singly Linked List:- 

	Step 1: Initialize the current pointer.

		Set current = head to start at the head of the list.

	Step 2: Traverse the list.

		- While current != null:
		- Check if the current node contains the value (current.data == targetValue).
		- If true, return the current node (or its position depending on implementation).
		- Otherwise, move to the next node (current = current.next).

	Step 3: If the loop finishes and the value is not found:

		Return null or indicate that the value was not found.
