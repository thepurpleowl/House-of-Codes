Delete a Node from the Beginning of a Singly Linked List:-

	Step 1: Check if the list is empty (i.e., head == null)

		If the list is empty, return an error or handle accordingly.

	Step 2: Set the head to point to the second node.

		head = head.next

	Step 3: The original head node is now deleted by garbage collection (in languages like Java or Python).

	Step 4:End.
