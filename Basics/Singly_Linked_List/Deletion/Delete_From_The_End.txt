Delete a Node from the End of a Singly Linked List:-

	Step 1: Check if the list is empty (i.e., head == null).

		If the list is empty, return an error or handle accordingly.

	Step 2: If there is only one node (i.e., head.next == null):

		Set head = null to remove the only node

	Step 3: If the list contains more than one node:

		- Traverse the list to find the second-to-last node (i.e., the node where current.next.next == null).
		- Set current.next = null.

	Step 4: End.
