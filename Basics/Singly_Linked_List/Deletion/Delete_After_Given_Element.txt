Delete a Node After a Given Element in a Singly Linked List:- 

	Step 1: Check if the list is empty (i.e., head == null).

		If the list is empty, return an error or handle accordingly.

	Step 2: Traverse the list to find the node with the given element (targetValue).

		current = head and move until current.data == targetValue.

	Step 3: If the target node is found and current.next is not null:

		Set current.next = current.next.next to remove the node after the target.

	Step 4: End.
