Insert a Node After a Given Value:-

	Step 1: Create a new node with the given data.
		newNode = new Node(data)
	Step 2: Traverse the list to find the node with the given value (let's say targetValue).
		current = head
		while (current != null and current.data != targetValue): move to the next node.
	Step 3: If the node with targetValue is found:
		-Set the next of the new node to current.next.
		-newNode.next = current.next
		-Set the next of the current node to the new node.
		-current.next = newNode
	Step 4: If the node with targetValue is not found, return an error or handle accordingly.

	Step 5:End.
