Insert a Node at the End: 

	Step 1: Create a new node with the given data.
		newNode = new Node(data)
	Step 2: If the list is empty (i.e., head == null):
		Set the new node as the head of the list.
		head = newNode
	Step 3: If the list is not empty:
		Traverse the list until the last node (i.e., where current.next == null).
		current = head
		while (current.next != null): move to the next node.
	Step 4: Set the next of the last node to the new node.
		current.next = newNode
	Step 5: End.
