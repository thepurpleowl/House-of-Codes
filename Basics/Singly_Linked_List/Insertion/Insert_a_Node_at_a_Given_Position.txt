Insert a Node at a Given Position:- 

	Step 1: Create a new node with the given data.
		newNode = new Node(data)
	Step 2: If the position is 1 (i.e., inserting at the head):

		- Set the next of the new node to the current head.
		- newNode.next = head
		- Update the head to the new node.
		- head = newNode
		- Return.

	Step 3: If the position is greater than 1, traverse the list to the node just before the desired position.

		- Initialize current = head
		- Initialize count = 1 (to track the position)
		- While current != null and count < position - 1:
		- Move to the next node (current = current.next)
		- Increment the count (count++)

	Step 4: If the desired position is valid (i.e., current is not null):

		- Set the next of the new node to current.next.
		- newNode.next = current.next
		- Set current.next to the new node.
		- current.next = newNode

	Step 5: If the position is invalid (i.e., the position is beyond the length of the list), return an error or handle it accordingly.

	Step 6: End.
