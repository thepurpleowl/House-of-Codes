 Insert a Node Before a Given Value:-

	Step 1: Create a new node with the given data.

		newNode = new Node(data)

	Step 2: If the list is empty, return an error or handle accordingly.

	Step 3: If the targetValue is at the head (i.e., head.data == targetValue):

		-Set the next of the new node to the current head.
		-newNode.next = head
		-Update the head to be the new node.
		-head = newNode

	Step 4: If targetValue is not at the head, traverse the list to find the node just before the node with targetValue.

		current = head
		while (current.next != null and current.next.data != targetValue): move to the next node.

	Step 5: If the node with targetValue is found:

		-Set the next of the new node to current.next.
		-newNode.next = current.next
		-Set the next of current to the new node.
		-current.next = newNode

	Step 6: If the node with targetValue is not found, return an error or handle accordingly.

	Step 7:End
